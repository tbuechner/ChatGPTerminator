I want to build an application focused on managing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). The application should accommodate the planning, tracking, and evaluation of OKRs within an organization. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary and analysis of the capabilities, main operations, and potential use cases for this application:

Central to this system is the concept of "Cycles," which are predefined periods, typically aligning with fiscal or calendar quarters, during which specific OKRs are pursued.

For each cycle, there are sets of objectives and key results that are tracked and evaluated. 
Tracking means, that the progress of each key result is monitored and updated regularly. The progress is measured in five levels: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.

We do not need a dedicated tracking type for the progress. Instead, the progress is tracked directly on the key result.
