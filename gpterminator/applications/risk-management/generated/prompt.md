### Application Description

I want to build an application which can be used to manage risks. It should be possible to identify, assess, and mitigate risks within the organization.

Mitigation actions should be represented in a separate type.


### Data Modeling - Meta Model

In order to implement the application, I would need to create a data model that stores the necessary information for managing data needed for the application.

The data model consists of types and attributes. Types are the entities that represent different concepts within the application, while attributes define the properties of these entities.

The following attribute types exist:

* Text: Used for storing textual information.
* Number: Used for storing numerical values.
* Date: Used for storing date and time information.
* Reference: Used for establishing relationships between entities.
* Text Enumeration: Used for defining a set of predefined values for an attribute.
* Number Enumeration: Used for defining a set of predefined numerical values for an attribute.
* Boolean: Used for storing true/false values.
* Rich Text: Used for storing formatted text.

There exists a built-in user type, we do not need a separate type for it. There can be references towards the built-in user type.

We do not need an explicit ID attribute for each type - unless there is a specific reason to have it.

The name of the reference should be the name of the type it is referring to. For example, if a Task refers to a Key Result, the reference should be named Key Result. If there are multiple references to the same type, use a descriptive name for the reference.


### High-Level Data Model

Here is a high-level data model for the application presented in tabular format - one table for each type with their corresponding attributes:


### Risk
| Attribute    | Type                  | Description                      |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Description | Text | Detailed description of the risk | 
| Probability | Number | Probability of the risk occurring | 
| Status | Text Enumeration | Current status of the risk (e.g., Open, In Progress, Mitigated, Closed) | 
| ResponsiblePerson | Reference | User who is responsible for the risk | 

### MitigationAction
| Attribute    | Type                  | Description                      |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Description | Rich Text | Detailed description of the mitigation action | 
| Risk | Reference | The risk that this mitigation action is related to | 
| ResponsiblePerson | Reference | User who is responsible for this mitigation action | 
| DueDate | Date | The date by which the mitigation action should be completed | 
| Status | Text Enumeration | Current status of the mitigation action (e.g., Planned, In Progress, Completed) | 
| Effectiveness | Number | The effectiveness rating of the mitigation action (e.g., 1 to 5) | 
| Comments | Rich Text | Additional comments regarding the mitigation action | 


### Detailed Data Model

Here is the current detailed data model in JSON. This is specifically about the detailed data model for the application:

### Task: Generate a Detailed Data Model Based on the High-Level Data Model

Provide instructions for how to adapt the detailed data model so that it fits with the high-level data model to meet the specific requirements of the organization or project.

Pay attention to whether all types which are present in the high-level data model are also present in the detailed data model. If not, you may need to add them.

Do not add types that are already present in the detailed data model.

Pay attention to whether all attributes which are present in the high-level data model are also present in the detailed data model. If not, you may need to add them.

This may include adding new types, modifying existing attributes, or creating references between entities.

The following operations can be performed on the detailed data model:

* Add a new type.
* Add a boolean attribute to a type.
* Add a date attribute to a type.
* Add a number attribute to a type.
* Add a string attribute to a type.
* Add a reference attribute to a type.
* Add a string enumeration attribute to a type.
* Add a integer enumeration attribute to a type.

If you think the detailed data model fits the high-level data model and the requirements of the application - give this as the response: "The current data model meets the requirements of the application."

The following instructions refer to the details of the detailed data model:
