I want to build an application which can be used to manage risks. It should be possible to identify, assess, and mitigate risks within the organization.

The impact of risks should be quantified with a *numerical* enumeration value. It should have five predefined values: Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, and Catastrophic.

Mitigation actions should be represented in a separate type.
