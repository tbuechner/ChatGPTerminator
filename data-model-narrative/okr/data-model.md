To implement the data model for your OKR management application, I will provide a setup that explicitly defines each type along with its attributes. Let's dive into the separate tables for types and their associated attributes:

### Type: Cycle
| Attribute     | Type            | Description                        |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Year          | Number          | The year of the cycle              |
| Quarter       | Number          | The quarter (1 to 4) of the cycle  |
| Start Date    | Date            | The starting date of the cycle     |
| End Date      | Date            | The ending date of the cycle       |
| Status        | Text Enumeration| Status of the cycle (Next, Current, Closed) |

### Type: Set
| Attribute     | Type            | Description                                      |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Title         | Text            | Title of the set                                |
| Description   | Rich Text       | Description of the set                          |
| Cycle         | Reference       | Reference to the associated Cycle                |

### Type: Objective
| Attribute     | Type            | Description                 |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Title         | Text            | Title of the objective      |
| Description   | Rich Text       | Description of the objective|
| Set           | Reference       | Reference to the associated Set |

### Type: Key Result
| Attribute     | Type            | Description                                |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Title         | Text            | Title of the key result                    |
| Description   | Rich Text       | Detailed description of the key result     |
| Objective     | Reference       | Reference to the associated Objective      |
| Assigned To   | Reference       | Reference to a User                        |
| Current Value | Number          | Current numeric value                      |
| Target Value  | Number          | Target numeric value                       |

### Type: Task
| Attribute     | Type            | Description                          |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Title         | Text            | Title of the task                    |
| Description   | Rich Text       | Detailed description of the task     |
| Key Result    | Reference       | Reference to the associated Key Result  |
| Assigned To   | Reference       | Reference to a User                  |
| Due Date      | Date            | Task completion due date             |
| Status        | Text Enumeration| Status of the task (e.g., Pending, Completed) |

This comprehensive data model will provide a strong foundation for the development of your OKR management application, ensuring all necessary components are captured accurately. This setup allows for meticulous tracking and management of objectives, key results, and associated tasks relevant to strategic organizational functions.
