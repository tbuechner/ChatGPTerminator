The JSON data you provided represents a comprehensive data model for an application centered around the concept of Objectives and Key Results (OKR). The data model defines various entities (referred to as types) and their attributes, which play crucial parts in managing and tracking the progress of objectives and results within an organization.

The data model is intricate, aimed at supporting a robust framework for objective-driven management in organizations, optimizing visibility, accountability, and strategic alignment across different layers and teams.

### Capabilities and Main Operations

The application appears to facilitate:
- **Setting and Tracking** of organizational, team, and individual Objectives and their corresponding measurable outcomes (Key Results).
- **Monitoring Progress** on objectives and key results through status updates, confidence levels, and progress indicators.
- **Task Management** related to specific key results, including tracking responsibility, status, and due dates.
- **Analytical Overviews** through capabilities like linking objectives to organizational units, cycles, progress updates, and displaying all data on dashboards.
- **Planning and Forecasting** with features to predict grading forecasts and confidence levels on achieving key results.
- **Support Management** by linking key results to organizational units that can provide or receive support.

- **Tasks** are operational actions linked to specific **Key Results**.
- **Support** features linking to organizational units that offer minor and substantial support for key results implementation.
